## Compile and run

To compile and run the program, the config file must be created with the following format:
```
SEED=dns
PROTOCOL_VERSION=1
PORT=1
LOG=file
NPEERS=1
```
A working example of this is shown in the _example-config_ file.

Then we run the following command line:
```
cargo run -- configpath
```
